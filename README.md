🔧 Core Components Overview
Entity System (Hybrid ORM)
php
<?php
namespace App\Blog\Entities;

use Axiom\Database\Entity;

class Post extends Entity
{
    // Doctrine mappings
    #[Id, GeneratedValue, Column]
    protected int $id;
    
    #[Column]
    protected string $title;

    // Active Record convenience
    public static function published(): array
    {
        return static::where('status', 'published')->get();
    }
    
    // Relationships
    public function author(): User
    {
        return $this->relation('author');
    }
}
Service Layer Architecture
php
<?php
namespace App\Blog\Services;

use Axiom\Application\Base\Service;

class PostService extends Service
{
    protected $entity = Post::class;
    
    public function createWithTags(array $data, array $tags): Post
    {
        // Business logic separated from controllers
        $post = Post::create($data);
        $post->tags()->sync($tags);
        return $post;
    }
