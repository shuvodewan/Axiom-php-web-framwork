            <p class="text-jus mt-4"> Green growth aims to transform key economic sectors by integrating sustainable practices that balance economic development with environmental health, social equity, and resilience. In the energy sector, the focus is on shifting to renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydropower, and boosting energy efficiency to reduce our environmental footprint. The transport sector plays its part by encouraging public transit, electric and hybrid vehicles, and walking and cycling, all of which cut down emissions and foster cleaner, healthier cities. Infrastructure development is another crucial area, where constructing energy-efficient structures and retrofitting older ones help conserve resources and reduce carbon emissions. In agriculture and forestry, sustainable practices like organic farming and ecosystem restoration can also protect natural resources and promote biodiversity. Manufacturing and industry can contribute by adopting cleaner production methods and minimizing waste and emissions, aligning economic activity with environmental sustainability while effective waste management—through recycling, reuse, and proper disposal—ensures that we make the most of our resources and reduce pollution. Even sectors like tourism have a part to play and are becoming greener by promoting tours which can be beneficial for both the environment and the local community in the area. Together, these sectors embody the principles of green growth by prioritizing innovation, sustainable use of resources, and inclusive policies, setting the stage for a more sustainable and equitable future. </p>
